# Tower Defense Game

- before running index.html file open terminal and type "npm i" and "npm start"

## todos

- Set specific shooting order to towers
- If hovered over towers images show their attribures like dmg, attack speed etc.
- Wave managment ( so when user is not on page the waves won't stack one upon each other)
- Attack Speed Upgrade fix ( When upgrading even a small as amount the tower is much better)
- change bullets into images
- bubble bullets should have slowed movement
